# CATganisation - Cat Breeds App

Technologies: MVVM architecture, RxJava, Hilt, Navigation Component, Retrofit



Cats need your help, we want to build an app where everyone can login and see beautiful cats, because they are so amazing.

For the login part, our backend is not yet ready, so you will need to mock the backend responses, and do a "local" login until the backend is ready.

But don't worry and try to be as close as possible to the final implementation. Whatever you define as requests and responses, we will mimick what you've done in the final implementation of the backend.

To get the info you need about cats please get familiar with https://docs.thecatapi.com/

When our catstomers enter our app, we want that they see an alphabetical ordered list of all the cat breeds that are available. Customers should be able to filter the breeds by country.

Each cat breed will be shown in a "card" with a small image on the left side, and the name and description of the cat breed in the rest of the card.

When a card is tapped, we will show a details page, where we will put the image, the name, description, country code, the temperament and Wikipedia link of the particular breed.
